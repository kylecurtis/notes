## Creating Variables

In Python, variables are created the moment you assign a value to them. Python is dynamically-typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable.

```python
x = 5
y = "Hello"
```

## Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like `x` and `y`) or a more descriptive name (like `age`, `car_name`, `total_volume`).

Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`age`, `Age` and `AGE` are three different variables)

## Assigning Multiple Values

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
```

<br>

Or assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:

```python
x = y = z = "Orange"
```
