In Python, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can "call" the function by name.

## Defining Functions

```python
# Defining a simple function
def greet():
    print("Hello, World!")

# Calling the function
greet()  # Output: Hello, World!
```

<br>

## Functions that Return a Value

When a function returns a value, that value can be assigned to a variable, used as part of an expression, passed as an argument to another function, and so forth. It can be manipulated and used elsewhere in your code as you would any other value.

```python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

sum = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(sum)  # Output: 7
```

In this example, the `add_numbers()` function takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the result. The returned value is then stored in the variable `sum`.

Understanding the difference between printing and returning is important. If you want to use the result of a function elsewhere in your code, you should use `return`. If you just want to see the output but don't need to use it elsewhere, you can use `print`.

## Arguments

Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice
```

## Keyword Arguments

You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax. This way the order of the arguments does not matter.

```python
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
    print("\nI have a " + animal_type + ".")
    print("My " + animal_type + "'s name is " + pet_name + ".")

describe_pet(animal_type="hamster", pet_name="Harry")
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Default Arguments

A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.

```python
def describe_pet(pet_name, animal_type='dog'):
    print("\nI have a " + animal_type + ".")
    print("My " + animal_type + "'s name is " + pet_name + ".")

describe_pet(pet_name='Willie')
```

<br>

## Arbitrary Arguments (\*args)

Sometimes, we do not know in advance the number of arguments that will be passed into a function. Python allows us to handle this kind of situation through function calls with an arbitrary number of arguments.

```python
def make_pizza(*toppings):
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print("- " + topping)

make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
```

<br>

<br>

## Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (\*\*kwargs)

If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into a function, add two asterisk: \*\* before the parameter name in the function definition.

```python
# Defining a function
def print_keyword_arguments(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key} = {value}")

# Calling the function
print_keyword_arguments(name="John Doe", age=30, country="USA")
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Scope of Variables

A variable is only available from inside the region it is created. This is called scope. A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.

```python
def myfunc():
    x = 300
    print(x)

myfunc()  # Output: 300
```

## Debugging Functions

Debugging is the routine process of locating and removing bugs, errors or abnormalities from programs. Python has a built-in pdb module for debugging. Here's a simple usage:

```python
def seq(n):
    for i in range(n):
        pdb.set_trace()  # breakpoint
        print(i)
    return

seq(5)
```

When the breakpoint is hit, the pdb debugger is started in the command line. You can type `help` to view a list of commands. Then, you can print variablesâ€™ values, go up and down in the call stack, etc.

Remember that Python functions can be quite complex, including nested functions, recursive functions and lambda functions. Understanding the basics is essential for writing effective Python code.
