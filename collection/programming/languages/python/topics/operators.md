<br>

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

<br>

<br>

## Arithmetic Operators

<br>

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

```python
# Addition
print(1 + 1)  # Output: 2

# Subtraction
print(2 - 1)  # Output: 1

# Multiplication
print(2 * 2)  # Output: 4

# Division
print(10 / 2)  # Output: 5.0

# Modulus
print(10 % 3)  # Output: 1

# Exponent
print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8

# Floor division
print(10 // 3)  # Output: 3
```

## Comparison Operators

<br>

Comparison operators are used to compare values. It either returns `True` or `False` according to the condition.

```python
# Equal to
print(2 == 2)  # Output: True

# Not equal to
print(2 != 2)  # Output: False

# Greater than
print(3 > 2)  # Output: True

# Less than
print(2 < 3)  # Output: True

# Greater than or equal to
print(3 >= 2)  # Output: True

# Less than or equal to
print(2 <= 3)  # Output: True
```

<br>

<br>

## Logical Operators

<br>

Logical operators are the `and`, `or`, `not` operators.

```python
# and operator - True if both the operands are true
x, y = True, False
print(x and y)  # Output: False

# or operator - True if either of the operands is true
print(x or y)  # Output: True

# not operator - True if operand is false
print(not x)  # Output: False
```

<br>

<br>

## Assignment Operators

<br>

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

```python
a = 10  # Assign value 10 to a
a += 10  # Add AND: Add right side to left side and assign to left side (equivalent to a = a + 10)
a -= 10  # Subtract AND (equivalent to a = a - 10)
a *= 10  # Multiply AND (equivalent to a = a * 10)
a /= 10  # Divide AND (equivalent to a = a / 10)
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Identity Operators

<br>

`is` and `is not` are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory.

```python
a = 5
b = 5
print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Bitwise Operators

<br>

Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit, hence the name.

```python
a = 10  # binary: 1010
b = 4   # binary: 0100

# bitwise AND
print(a & b)  # Output: 0 (binary: 0000)

# bitwise OR
print(a | b)  # Output: 14 (binary: 1110)

# bitwise NOT
print(~a)  # Output: -11 (binary: -(1011))
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Ternary Operators

<br>

Ternary operators evaluate something based on a condition being true or not. It is a shortcut for the `if` statement.

```python
x, y = 10, 20

# If condition is true, then x otherwise y
print(x if x < y else y)  # Output: 10
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Chaining Comparison Operators

<br>

An interesting feature of Python is the ability to chain multiple comparisons to perform a more complex test.

```python
x = 10

# check if x is greater than 5 AND less than 15
print(5 < x < 15)  # Output: True
```

<br>

## Unpacking Operators in Python

<br>

Unpacking operators, commonly known as the splat (`*`) and double-splat (`**`) operators, allow you to extract values from iterables in Python. They're integral in various contexts, including function arguments, multiple assignment, and data structure transformations. 

<br>

#### `*` Operator

The single asterisk (`*`) is used for unpacking iterables such as lists and tuples:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a, *b, c = numbers
print(a)  # 1
print(b)  # [2, 3]
print(c)  # 4
```

In the example above, `b` captures the middle portion of the list, demonstrating the flexibility of the `*` operator.

<br>

#### `**` Operator

The double asterisk (`**`) is used to unpack dictionaries. Each key-value pair in the dictionary becomes a named argument:

```python
data = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
def display_data(name, age):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")

display_data(**data)  # Outputs: John is 25 years old
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Unpacking in Function Arguments

<br>

#### *args

In function definitions, the `*` operator is used to capture a variable number of positional arguments into a tuple:

```python
def function_with_args(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print(arg)

function_with_args(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Outputs each number on a new line
```

<br>

#### \**kwargs

Similarly, the `**` operator captures a variable number of keyword arguments into a dictionary:

```python
def function_with_kwargs(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key} = {value}")

function_with_kwargs(name="Alice", age=30)  # Outputs each key-value pair on a new line
```

<br>

<br>

## Merging Iterables

<br>

#### Lists and Tuples

You can use the `*` operator to merge two or more lists or tuples:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
merged_list = [*list1, *list2]
print(merged_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### Dictionaries

The `**` operator allows merging of dictionaries:

```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}
merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}
print(merged_dict)  # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

Note that if the dictionaries have overlapping keys, the value from the latter dictionary (`dict2` in the example) will overwrite the previous one.

<br>

---

<br>

## Extended Uses

<br>

#### Nested Unpacking

Python supports nested unpacking for more complex data structures:

```python
data = [1, [2, 3, 4], 5]
a, (b, *c), d = data
print(a, b, c, d)  # Outputs: 1 2 [3, 4] 5
```

<br>

#### Passing Iterables to Functions

The unpacking operators can be utilized when you have an iterable, and a function expects separate positional arguments:

```python
def function(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

args = [1, 2, 3]
function(*args)  # Outputs: 1 2 3
```

<br>

---

<br>

## Considerations and Best Practices

- **Readability:** While unpacking can make code concise, overuse might harm readability. Use unpacking operators where they make the code clearer, not just shorter.
  
- **Fixed and Variable Parts:** When using unpacking in variable assignments, it's generally clear if there's a fixed part (like `a` and `c` in the first example). Ensure the variable part (`*b` in the first example) logically captures the variable essence of your data.
  
- **Overwriting Values:** Be cautious when merging dictionaries using `**`. If there's a key overlap, the latter value will overwrite the former, potentially leading to lost data.
