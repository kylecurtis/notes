Circles are a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a given point called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius.

## Standard Form of the Equation of a Circle

The standard form of the equation of a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\) is:

$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$

<br>

For a circle with its center at the origin, this simplifies to:

$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$

## General Form of the Equation of a Circle

The general form is:

$Ax^2 + Ay^2 + Bx + Cy + D = 0$

Where \(A = 1\). This can be transformed into standard form through completing the square.

## Unit Circle

A unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 and its center at the origin of a coordinate plane. The equation of the unit circle is:

$x^2 + y^2 = 1$

The unit circle is fundamental in trigonometry.

## Finding Intercepts of a Circle

### x-intercepts:
To find the x-intercepts, set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$.

### y-intercepts:
To find the y-intercepts, set $x = 0$ and solve for $y$.

## Graphing a Circle

1. **Identify the center and radius**: From the equation, determine the values of $h$, $k$, and $r$.

2. **Plot the center**: On a coordinate plane, plot the point $(h, k)$.

3. **Draw the circle**: From the center, draw a circle with the radius $r$.

## Diameter, Chord, and Tangent

- **Diameter**: A line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has its endpoints on the circle.
- **Chord**: A line segment with both endpoints on the circle.
- **Tangent**: A line that touches the circle at exactly one point.

## Circle Equation Practice 01

### Problem

Given:
$r = 4$
$(h, k) = (0, 0)$

Write the standard form of the equation of the circle and explain how to graph it.

<br>

### Solution:

**1. Plug into the Standard Form of a Circle Equation:**

Using the standard form formula for the equation of a circle:
$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$

With the given values:
$(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 4^2$

This simplifies to:
$x^2 + y^2 = 16$

<br>

**2. Graphing the Circle:**

- **Step 1:** Identify the center. From the equation, the center is at \((h, k) = (0, 0)\).
- **Step 2:** Plot the center on the graph. In this case, the center is the origin, so plot the point (0, 0).
- **Step 3:** Use the radius to plot points around the center. From the center, mark a point 4 units left, 4 units right, 4 units up, and 4 units down.
- **Step 4:** Draw the circle. Using the points you plotted, draw a smooth circle around the center.

With the above steps, you will have graphed the circle with the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 16 \) on a coordinate plane.
