When you have an equation with an absolute value, it means the expression inside the absolute value could be equal to the value given or its negative. This is because the absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, so both a positive and its corresponding negative have the same absolute value.

## Absolute Value Equation 01

<br>

### Problem

$|3x+4| = 6$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Set up Two Equations**: 

   For the expression inside the absolute value to equal the number outside the absolute value, it can either be directly equal to that number or its negative. This means you'll set up two equations.

   a. $3x + 4 = 6$

   b. $3x + 4 = -6$

<br>

2. **Solve Each Equation**:

   a. For the first equation $3x + 4 = 6$:

   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   
   $3x = 2$
   
   Divide both sides by 3:
   
   $x = \frac{2}{3}$

   b. For the second equation $3x + 4 = -6$:

   Subtract 4 from both sides:
   
   $3x = -10$

   Divide both sides by 3:
   
   $x = -\frac{10}{3}$ or $-3\frac{1}{3}$

<br>

3. **State the Solutions**:

   The solutions to the equation $|3x+4| = 6$ are:

   $x = \frac{2}{3}$ and $x = -\frac{10}{3}$ or $-3\frac{1}{3}$.

<br>

It's important to always check your solutions in the original equation to ensure they are correct. In this case, plugging both $\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{10}{3}$ back into the original equation confirms that they are indeed the correct solutions.

Absolutely! I can certainly use that format for your notes. Let's solve the next absolute value equation:

## Absolute Value Equation 02

<br>

### Problem

$|2-2t| + 2 = 10$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value**:

   Start by subtracting 2 from each side of the equation to isolate the absolute value expression.
   
   Resulting in:
   
   $|2-2t| = 8$

<br>

2. **Set up Two Equations**:

   As with any absolute value equation, we can set up two equations: one where the expression inside the absolute value equals the given value and one where it equals the negative of the given value.

   a. $2 - 2t = 8$

   b. $2 - 2t = -8$

<br>

3. **Solve Each Equation**:

   a. For the first equation $2 - 2t = 8$:

   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   
   $-2t = 6$
   
   Divide both sides by -2:
   
   $t = -3$

   b. For the second equation $2 - 2t = -8$:

   Subtract 2 from both sides:
   
   $-2t = -10$
   
   Divide both sides by -2:
   
   $t = 5$

<br>

4. **State the Solutions**:

   The solutions to the equation $|2-2t| + 2 = 10$ are:

   $t = -3$ and $t = 5$.

## Absolute Value Equation 03

<br>

### Problem

$| \frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} | = 3$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Set up Two Equations**:

   Remembering the nature of absolute value, we can create two possible equations: one where the expression inside the absolute value equals the number outside and one where it's the negative of that number.

   a. $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = 3$

   b. $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = -3$

<br>

2. **Solve Each Equation**:

   a. For the first equation $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = 3$:

   Start by getting a common denominator. Here, it's 12. Multiply every term by 12:
   
   $4x + 9 = 36$
   
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   
   $4x = 27$
   
   Divide both sides by 4:
   
   $x = \frac{27}{4}$ or $6\frac{3}{4}$

   b. For the second equation $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} = -3$:

   Again, using a common denominator of 12, multiply every term:
   
   $4x + 9 = -36$
   
   Subtract 9 from both sides:
   
   $4x = -45$
   
   Divide both sides by 4:
   
   $x = -\frac{45}{4}$ or $-11\frac{1}{4}$

<br>

3. **State the Solutions**:

   The solutions to the equation $| \frac{x}{3} + \frac{3}{4} | = 3$ are:

   $x = 6\frac{3}{4}$ and $x = -11\frac{1}{4}$.

## Absolute Value Inequality 04

<br>

### Problem

$|x-9| + 5 < 9$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value**:

   Begin by subtracting 5 from each side of the inequality to get the absolute value expression on its own.
   
   Resulting in:
   
   $|x-9| < 4$

<br>

2. **Set up Two Inequalities**:

   Given the nature of absolute value, the inner expression can either be less than 4 or greater than -4.

   a. $x - 9 < 4$

   b. $x - 9 > -4$

<br>

3. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $x - 9 < 4$:

   Add 9 to both sides:
   
   $x < 13$

   b. For the second inequality $x - 9 > -4$:

   Add 9 to both sides:
   
   $x > 5$

<br>

4. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      $x \in (5, 13)$

      In this notation, x lies between 5 and 13, but doesn't include 5 or 13. The parentheses indicate non-inclusivity.

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $x \in \{x | 5 < x < 13\}$

      This can be read as "x belongs to the set of numbers such that x is greater than 5 and less than 13."

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line, place an open circle at 5 and another open circle at 13. Shade or draw a line connecting these two circles, symbolizing all the numbers between 5 and 13 (excluding 5 and 13 themselves). The open circles indicate the endpoints are not part of the solution.

## Absolute Value Inequality 05

<br>

### Problem

$|7t-2| \leq 12$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Set up Two Inequalities**:

   Due to the nature of the absolute value, the expression inside can either be directly less than or equal to 12 or greater than or equal to -12.

   a. $7t - 2 \leq 12$

   b. $7t - 2 \geq -12$

<br>

2. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $7t - 2 \leq 12$:

   Add 2 to both sides:
   
   $7t \leq 14$

   Divide both sides by 7:
   
   $t \leq 2$

   b. For the second inequality $7t - 2 \geq -12$:

   Add 2 to both sides:
   
   $7t \geq -10$

   Divide both sides by 7:
   
   $t \geq -\frac{10}{7}$ or $t \geq -1\frac{3}{7}$

<br>

3. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      $t \in [-1\frac{3}{7}, 2]$

      This notation indicates that t lies between or is equal to $-1\frac{3}{7}$ and 2. The square brackets signify inclusivity of the endpoints.

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $t \in \{t | -1\frac{3}{7} \leq t \leq 2\}$

      This is read as "t belongs to the set of numbers such that t is greater than or equal to $-1\frac{3}{7}$ and less than or equal to 2."

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line, place a closed circle (indicating inclusivity) at $-1\frac{3}{7}$ and another closed circle at 2. Shade or draw a line connecting these two circles, representing all the numbers between and including these values.

## Absolute Value Inequality 06

<br>

### Problem

$|4x-11| \geq 6$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Set up Two Inequalities**:

   Due to the nature of the absolute value, when the absolute value of an expression is greater than or equal to a positive value, it can mean that the inner expression is either directly greater than or equal to that value or less than or equal to its negative counterpart.

   a. $4x - 11 \geq 6$

   b. $4x - 11 \leq -6$

<br>

2. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $4x - 11 \geq 6$:

   Add 11 to both sides:
   
   $4x \geq 17$

   Divide both sides by 4:
   
   $x \geq \frac{17}{4}$ or $x \geq 4.25$

   b. For the second inequality $4x - 11 \leq -6$:

   Add 11 to both sides:
   
   $4x \leq 5$

   Divide both sides by 4:
   
   $x \leq 1.25$

<br>

3. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      The solution consists of two separate intervals:

      $t \in (-\infty, 1.25] \cup [4.25, \infty)$

      This denotes that x is either less than or equal to 1.25 or greater than or equal to 4.25.

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $x \in \{x | x \leq 1.25 \text{ or } x \geq 4.25\}$

      This is read as "x belongs to the set of numbers such that x is less than or equal to 1.25 or x is greater than or equal to 4.25."

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line, place a closed circle (indicating inclusivity) at 1.25 and another closed circle at 4.25. Shade or draw a line going to the left from 1.25 and another going to the right from 4.25, representing the values of x that satisfy the inequality.

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value**:

   Start by moving the constants to the other side.

   $|1-6x| < 7$

<br>

2. **Set up Two Inequalities**:

   Due to the nature of the absolute value, when the absolute value of an expression is less than a positive value, it can mean that the inner expression is either directly less than that value and greater than its negative counterpart.

   a. $1-6x < 7$

   b. $1-6x > -7$

<br>

3. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $1-6x < 7$:

   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   
   $-6x < 6$

   Divide both sides by -6 (remember to flip the inequality direction when dividing by a negative number):
   
   $x > -1$

   b. For the second inequality $1-6x > -7$:

   Subtract 1 from both sides:
   
   $-6x > -8$

   Divide both sides by -6 (again, remember to flip the inequality direction):
   
   $x < \frac{4}{3}$ or $x < 1.33$

<br>

4. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      The solution is a combination of the two intervals:

      $x \in (-1, \frac{4}{3})$

      This denotes that $x$ is greater than -1 and less than $\frac{4}{3}$.

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $x \in \{x | -1 < x < \frac{4}{3}\}$

      This is read as "x belongs to the set of numbers such that x is greater than -1 and less than $\frac{4}{3}$".

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line, place an open circle (indicating exclusivity) at -1 and another open circle at $\frac{4}{3}$. Shade or draw a line between these two points, representing the values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality.

   When the absolute value of an expression is greater than a positive value, it can mean that the inner expression is either directly greater than that value or less than its negative counterpart.

   a. $7-2x > 11$

   b. $7-2x < -11$

<br>

2. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $7-2x > 11$:

   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   
   $-2x > 4$

   Divide both sides by -2 (remember to flip the inequality direction when dividing by a negative number):
   
   $x < -2$

   b. For the second inequality $7-2x < -11$:

   Subtract 7 from both sides:
   
   $-2x < -18$

   Divide both sides by -2:
   
   $x > 9$

<br>

3. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      The solution is a union of the two intervals:

      $x \in (-\infty, -2) \cup (9, \infty)$

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $x \in \{x | x < -2 \text{ or } x > 9\}$

      This is read as "x belongs to the set of numbers such that x is less than -2 or greater than 9".

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line:
      
      - Place an open circle (indicating exclusivity) at -2 and another open circle at 9.

## Absolute Value Inequality 09

<br>

### Problem

$-3 |2x-1| \geq -9$

<br>

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Isolate the Absolute Value**:

   Start by dividing both sides by -3 to isolate the absolute value. Remember, when we divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, we need to reverse the direction of the inequality.
   
   $|2x-1| \leq 3$

<br>

2. **Set up Two Inequalities**:

   For the expression inside the absolute value to be less than or equal to a positive value, it can mean that the inner expression is either directly less than or equal to that value or greater than or equal to its negative counterpart.

   a. $2x-1 \leq 3$

   b. $2x-1 \geq -3$

<br>

3. **Solve Each Inequality**:

   a. For the first inequality $2x-1 \leq 3$:

   Add 1 to both sides:
   
   $2x \leq 4$

   Divide both sides by 2:
   
   $x \leq 2$

   b. For the second inequality $2x-1 \geq -3$:

   Add 1 to both sides:
   
   $2x \geq -2$

   Divide both sides by 2:
   
   $x \geq -1$

<br>

4. **State the Solution Representation**:

   1. **Interval Notation**:

      The solution is an intersection of the two intervals:

      $x \in [-1, 2]$

      This denotes that $x$ is between -1 and 2, inclusive.

   <br>

   2. **Set Builder Notation**:

      $x \in \{x | -1 \leq x \leq 2\}$

      This is read as "x belongs to the set of numbers such that x is greater than or equal to -1 and less than or equal to 2".

   <br>

   3. **Graphing**:

      On a number line:
      
      - Place a closed circle (indicating inclusivity) at -1 and another closed circle at 2.
      - Shade the segment between -1 and 2, inclusive.
