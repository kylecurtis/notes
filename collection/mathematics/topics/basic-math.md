This section covers the fundamental topics in mathematics, although not all topics may be covered.

## Addition (Sum)

The combination of two numbers to become one.

- Addition is commutative (the order of the numbers does not affect the final result).
<br>
- Addition is associative (the order of multiple additions does not affect the final result).

#### Sum Of Small Numbers

$2 + 3 = 5$

This equation reads: two *plus* three *equals* five.

<br>

<br>

## Subtraction (Difference)

The inverse of addition, giving the difference between numbers.

- Subtraction is not commutative (the order does affect the final result).
<br>
- Subtraction is not associative (the order of multiple subtractions does affect the final result).

#### Difference Of Small Numbers

$5 - 1 = 4$

This equation reads: five *minus* one *equals* 4.

<br>

## Multiplication (Product)

An abbreviated form of repeated addition.

- Multiplication combines identical groups of items into a single larger number (product).
<br>
- Multiplication is commutative ($5 * 2 = 2 * 5$)
<br>
- Multiplication is also associative (Order does not change output)

<br>

#### Multiplication Of Small Numbers

$2 * 5 = 10$

This is the same as writing:

$2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10$

## Division (Quotient)

- Division is not  commutative ($10/2 \neq 2/10$)
<br>
- Division is not associative (Order does change the result).

## Fraction Basics

<br>

#### Division Refresh

$15 \div 5 = 3$

- The $15$ is the dividend.
- The $5$ is the divisor.
- The $3$ is the quotient.

<br>

#### Structure Of A Fraction

$\frac{2}{4}$

- The $2$ is a numerator 
- The $4$ is the denominator.
-  This fraction implies that the numerator (2) is being divided by the denominator (4).

<br>

#### Simplifying Fractions

The fraction $\frac{2}{8}$ can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by the same number.

$\frac{2 \div 2}{8 \div 2} = \frac{1}{4}$

<br>

#### Comparing Fractions

- It's easier to compare fractions when the denominators are the same.
- When both fractions have the same denominator, the fraction with the higher numerator is larger.

$\frac{3}{8}$ and $\frac{5}{8}$

<br>

#### Improper Fractions & Mixed Numbers

- Improper fractions occur when the numerator is larger than the denominator. 

The fraction $\frac{4}{3}$ is an improper fraction.

- Mixed numbers occur when a fraction is accompanied by a whole number.

The fraction $1\frac{1}{3}$ is a mixed number.

<br>

#### Converting Improper Fractions To Mixed Numbers

To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, you must:

- Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the whole number
- The remaining number becomes the numerator of the fraction.
- The original denominator stays the same.

Example: $\frac{8}{3}$

- $8 \div 3$ would equal 2 (with 2 left over as numerator).
- $\frac{2}{3}$ would be the remaining fraction (with 3 as the remaining denominator).

Final result: $\frac{8}{3} = 2\frac{2}{3}$

<br>

#### Converting  Mixed Numbers To Improper Fractions

To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,  you must:

- Multiply the denominator by the whole number.
- Add the result to the numerator.
- Keep the original denominator.

Example: $1\frac{2}{3}$

- $3 * 1$ would equal 3.
- $3 + 2$ would equal 5 (which becomes the numerator).
- 3 remains the same.

Final result: $1\frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}$
